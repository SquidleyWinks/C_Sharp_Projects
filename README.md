 Basic Projects

CarInsurance:
This is an MVC website meant to imitate an application for car insurance.
Business logic is applied to the information input by the user to determine their estimated rate.
That information is then stroed in a database via the Entity framework.

Blackjack:
This is a console game imitating Blackjack played in Hell.
The rules for calculating player scores, as well as if the dealer needs to hit or stay, are all programmed accordingly.
Eventual implementation of a Split function would be the next addition.

Basic Projects:
These are various assignments given by The Tech Academy to explore the functionality of C#
While they are more abstract and unfocused, they show the wide variety of methods covered.
